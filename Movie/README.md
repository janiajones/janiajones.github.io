# How to Pass a University Exam (As an Alien!)

## Project Description
Our project is a 3-part comedic video teaching aliens how to pass a university exam in three chaotic steps. The concept blends humor with relatability, using the "five stages of grief" model (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance) to mirror the emotional journey students experience during exam season. 

The theme is playful and absurd, enhanced by 80s/90s-style editing for a nostalgic, infomercial-like tone. We wanted to create an engaging, funny, and slightly surreal experience that both entertains and resonates with university students.

The web page hosting the video features a short interactive experience: users must verify if they are a human or an alien before accessing the content. The color palette and visual design of the site draw inspiration from stereotypical "alien" aesthetics — neon greens and purples — to fully immerse the viewer.

## Process
We began by brainstorming various "how-to" ideas and ultimately decided on the humorous concept of helping aliens pass exams, inspired by our own exam season experiences. We structured the video series into three main parts:

1. **Denial and Anger**
2. **Bargaining**
3. **Depression and Acceptance**

Each step was broken down into relatable moments — such as procrastinating, panic-calling parents, last-minute cramming, and emotional breakdowns — all dramatized with an alien twist.

**Group Roles:**
- **Alien Character / Website Design**: Jania
- **Filming / Colorist**: Nomundari
- **Sound Engineer**: Guli
- **Alien Friend / Narrator / Editing**: Amelia

We filmed original content, emphasizing exaggerated acting and comedic timing. 

The website includes an interactive check at the start to confirm whether the viewer is a human or alien, setting the comedic tone for the video experience.

## Reflection / Evaluation
Overall, we successfully met our project goals. We created a cohesive, entertaining, and humorous three-part series that aligns with our original vision. The styling, editing, and interactivity came together to form a unique, playful experience.

**What we could have improved:**
- We could have enhanced the website with more alien-themed interactivity (like a mini-quiz or small game).

Despite these minor areas for improvement, we are proud of the final product and of how well we collaborated as a team.
